Installing Git on Linux
Red Hat-based linux systems: CentOS
	sudo yum upgrade
	sudo yum install git

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation
	To install OpenJDK 8 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux:
	Ensure that you have enabled the Optional channel, by running the following commands:
	    su  [then enter administrator password]
	    yum repolist all
	    yum-config-manager --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
    Install the OpenJDK 8 package, by running the following command:

    	    yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
If you really want to remove all of the repository, leaving only the working directory then it should be as simple as this.
	rm -rf .git

Initializing git after cloning a repo
1.git init
2.git config user.name "someone"
3.git config user.email "someone@someplace.com"

git status :: tells the status if I committed, added, ...
git add -A :: add all files in folder
git commit -m "message" :: attach added files to local repository
git push :: push committed files to remote git repository


How can I delete a file from git repo?
    git rm file1.txt
But if you want to remove the file only from the Git repository and not remove it from the filesystem, use:
    git commit -m "remove file1.txt"
And to push changes to remote repo
    git push origin branch_name
