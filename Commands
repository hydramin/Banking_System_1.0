Red Hat Enterprise Linux Installation
	To install OpenJDK 8 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux:
	Ensure that you have enabled the Optional channel, by running the following commands:
	    su  [then enter administrator password]
	    yum repolist all
	    yum-config-manager --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
    Install the OpenJDK 8 package, by running the following command:

    	    yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
If you really want to remove all of the repository, leaving only the working directory then it should be as simple as this.
	rm -rf .git
git status
git add -A
git commit
